# NYC Public School SAT Analysis

This project analyzes SAT performance data across New York City public high schools to identify top-performing schools, evaluate borough-level performance variability, and uncover trends in academic achievement.

## Overview

Using a dataset of SAT scores broken down by subject (math, reading, and writing), the notebook addresses the following questions, among others:

1. Which schools have the strongest math performance?
2. Which schools rank highest in combined SAT scores?
3. Which borough exhibits the largest variability in SAT scores?

The analysis includes:
- Data cleaning and transformation using pandas
- Summary statistics and group-level aggregation
- Data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn
- Exploratory insights based on score distributions and borough-level comparisons

## Tools Used

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings

- Specialized schools such as Stuyvesant and Bronx Science consistently achieve top scores.
- Manhattan demonstrates the highest variation in SAT scores, suggesting both exceptional and underperforming schools in the borough.
